# Virtualization SDK Repository

This is the Markdown-based documentation for the Virtualization SDK.

## Live Testing and Reviews
The command `git docsdev-review` will handle publishing reviews, and putting your changes on a live docs server. For example, you can clone the `docsdev-server` image on DCOA, and then run `git docsdev-review -m <yourvm.dlpxdc.co>`. This will:

- Push your doc changes to your VM
- Give you a link to the docdev server so you can test your changes live in a browser
- Publish a review
